
 Breakdown of the Script Code

1. $(document).ready(function() { ... });

Purpose: This ensures that the code inside it runs only after the entire HTML document has been loaded and is ready for manipulation. This is essential for making sure your jQuery code interacts with the DOM elements correctly.

Example: If you have a function that attaches event handlers, you want to make sure that the elements those handlers will be attached to exist in the DOM first. `$(document).ready` is a convenient way to achieve this.

2. `function getCookie(name) { ... }

Purpose: This function retrieves the value of a cookie by its name. Cookies are often used to store small pieces of data on the client side, such as session identifiers or authentication tokens.

How it Works:
  document.cookie: This is a string containing all cookies for the current document.
  document.cookie.split(';'): Splits the cookie string into individual cookies.
cookie.substring(0, name.length + 1) === (name + '='): Checks if the cookieâ€™s name matches the desired name.
  - **`decodeURIComponent(cookie.substring(name.length + 1))`**: Decodes and retrieves the value of the cookie.

Example: If you have a cookie named `csrftoken`, calling `getCookie('csrftoken')` will return its value.

3. const csrftoken = getCookie('csrftoken')`

Purpose: This line calls the `getCookie` function to retrieve the CSRF token value from cookies and stores it in the `csrftoken` variable.

Example: This `csrftoken` is later used in AJAX requests to prevent CSRF attacks by validating requests on the server side.

 4. $.ajaxSetup({ beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) { ... } });

Purpose: This sets up default settings for all AJAX requests made using jQuery. Specifically, it adds the CSRF token to the request headers.

How it Work:
  beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) { ... }: This function is called before each AJAX request is sent.
  xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken", csrftoken): Adds the CSRF token to the `X-CSRFToken` header of the request. This ensures that the token is sent with every POST request to help prevent CSRF attacks.

Example: If you make a POST request to a server endpoint that requires CSRF protection, this setup ensures that the CSRF token is included in the request headers.

Summary

$(document).ready(): Ensures code runs after the DOM is fully loaded.
getCookie(name): Retrieves the value of a specified cookie.
csrftoken :Stores the CSRF token retrieved from cookies.
$.ajaxSetup(): Configures default AJAX settings to include the CSRF token in request headers.

N/B : These techniques ensure your AJAX requests are secure and that they interact correctly with the document and server-side logic.
